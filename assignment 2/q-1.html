        <h3>CSS allows for a clear separation between HTML content and design, making it easier to manage both.</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Using CSS can significantly reduce the size of HTML files since styles can be defined once and reused</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Changes to styles can be made in one place, affecting all pages that use those styles, simplifying updates</h3>
         <br>
         <h3>CSS enables the creation of responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices</h3>
         <br>
         <h3>By caching CSS files, browsers can load websites faster after the first visit</h3>
